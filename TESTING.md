## Bug and Fix

## Challenges Faced

### 1. User Authentication
- **Challenge:** Setting up user authentication was initially difficult, especially ensuring users could only edit their own profile, wishlist, and testimonials.
- **Solution:** Implemented Django's authentication system along with custom decorators to restrict user access to specific pages based on their login status.

### 2. Email Functionality
- **Challenge:** Configuring email functionality for user registration and password recovery was challenging, especially when setting up SMTP servers.
- **Solution:** Correctly configured the SMTP settings in `settings.py`, ensuring proper error handling for common authentication errors.

### 3. Image Uploads
- **Challenge:** Ensuring that profile pictures and product images uploaded properly and displayed correctly across different sections.
- **Solution:** Added media configurations, handled image file storage paths, and applied checks for missing images to improve user experience.

### 4. Database Relationships
- **Challenge:** Managing relationships between products, categories, reviews, and users posed issues when setting up foreign keys.
- **Solution:** Corrected the database models to establish proper foreign key and many-to-many relationships, especially between products, categories, and user profiles.

### 5. Template Rendering Issues
- **Challenge:** The Django template sometimes failed to render context variables correctly, leading to issues with the display of dynamic content.
- **Solution:** Carefully debugged the template context in views, ensuring that the data passed to the templates was accurate and properly handled.

## Lessons Learned
- Thoroughly test template variables and context data to ensure smooth page rendering.
- Pay attention to database relationships and how they impact views and templates.
- Ensure that media files (such as profile images) are properly configured in Django's settings and handled carefully in templates.

## Future Features
- Implement a recommendation system based on user behavior.
- Create user roles with different permission levels (admin, seller, buyer).



### Testing (Post Development Phase)
#### Validation

##### HTML
## Impact on Functionality

Despite the presence of these errors, it is important to note that they do not hinder the overall functionality of the website. The site continues to operate as intended, allowing users to navigate and access its features without issues. 

### Conclusion

While these errors indicate areas for improvement in the HTML structure, they do not affect the site's performance or user experience. Addressing these issues will enhance code quality and maintainability, ensuring compliance with web standards.

### Conclusion

Compiling all the user stories was a challenging yet ultimately rewarding endeavor. This process demanded meticulous attention to detail as I aimed to accurately capture each userâ€™s unique needs and experiences. Balancing the varying priorities of stakeholders proved particularly difficult, with different users often presenting conflicting requirements that complicated the search for common ground. Additionally, ensuring that each story was not only clear and concise but also aligned with the overall product vision required significant effort and focus. Effective time management became critical as I navigated multiple iterations, gathered feedback, and made necessary revisions. Ultimately, these challenges enriched my understanding of user needs and contributed to creating a more comprehensive and user-centered product roadmap.
